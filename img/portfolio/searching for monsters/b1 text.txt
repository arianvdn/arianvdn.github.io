The third hidden object book I have illustrated is called Searching for Monsters. Each of the 2 facing pages contain a main character which have larger dimensions than the rest of the work components and 16 items are hidden in the facing pages. Each of the Both facing pages are related together but have a completely separate topic from the rest of the other pages. The illustration style of the book is surreal and the details are still clear at a distance from the viewer. Unlike most Hidden Object books, the perspective is not isometric, and atmospheric perspective is used in order to understand the distances.
