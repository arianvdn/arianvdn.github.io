This is a book that I tried to put the details of the characters in every frame based on the way they live in the nature inside of the shape of them.
For example:
For the pigeon's frame I illustrated everything that has effected the pigeon's life and all the things that has been created in it's memory inside of it.
Living on the city. the buildings that although they have a positive pointØ› to change the wildness  by the flowers on top of them to make them look soft and smooth.I  actually wanted to announce a peacefull urbanization between the nature and the human.
In another frame we have a  turtle which has an ocean view inside. That Includes so many diffrent endless aquatics. also the human's  appreance by afew boats from the bottom angle of turtle.
I didn't put any trash bin to show the humanity in a nice way.
I used the color's and harmonied them next to each other to make it similar to us humans! Which although we have some diffrences but we still can live next to each other happily ever after in one society.
 In the end I'd like to say:
This book actually shows the Ideal look that I have about our lives and our world.
